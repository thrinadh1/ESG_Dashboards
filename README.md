#ESG Dashboards for Sustainability Monitoring
This project showcases the development of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) dashboards aimed at tracking and reporting on key sustainability metrics within organizations. The dashboards were designed to streamline the monitoring of ESG performance, ensuring data-driven decision-making and alignment with sustainability goals.

Project Overview:
During my internship at Sigachi Pharma Excipients Manufacturing Industries, I developed interactive ESG dashboards that allowed the organization to track its sustainability metrics in real-time. The dashboards improved compliance monitoring, reporting efficiency, and decision-making related to ESG initiatives.

Key Features:
Real-Time ESG Monitoring: Monitored various ESG indicators such as carbon emissions, waste management, energy consumption, diversity, and governance policies.
Customizable Visualizations: Included interactive visual elements like line charts, bar graphs, and KPI indicators to make ESG data accessible and actionable for decision-makers.
Efficiency Boost: Streamlined the ESG reporting process, reducing reporting time by 25% and making it easier for teams to access up-to-date sustainability metrics.
Data-Driven Insights: Incorporated advanced data analytics techniques to uncover trends, helping to set goals for continuous sustainability improvements.
Tools and Technologies Used:
Power BI: Used for building interactive and visually appealing dashboards, focusing on clear communication of sustainability metrics.
Excel: Performed data cleaning and analysis prior to visualizing the data in Power BI.
Key Impact:
Increased Reporting Efficiency: Reduced the time spent on ESG reporting by 25%, allowing the team to focus more on strategic initiatives.
Enhanced Decision-Making: Provided real-time, data-backed insights that enabled better decision-making in sustainability-related projects.
Training and Adoption: Delivered training on the use of Power BI dashboards, ensuring 100% adoption of the tool within the teams.
